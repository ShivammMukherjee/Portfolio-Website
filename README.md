Hi,I'm Shivam Mukherjee
This is my first project as a developer which you already know  by the name it's a portfilo website.

Here, I'm going to record my progress that i do as i create my portfilo website.

Dt- 9th November 2025:

    Today i integrated nodejs for backend(server) and react+vite for frontend(client)
    after learning it from youtube tutorial by ChaiaurCode.
    And also did some minor chages and etc.
    
    That's it for day.
    Keep learning, keep exploring.
